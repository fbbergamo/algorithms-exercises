# Question: Given an array and a value, how to implement a function to remove all instances of that value in place and return the new length? 
#The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

# For example, if the input array is {4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 6}, 
#the result array after removing value 2 contains numbers {4, 3, 1, 3, 6}, and the new length of the remaining array is 5.
